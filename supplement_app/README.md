# Supplement Analysis App

This is a skeletal implementation of an application that manages supplement data using an LLM for evidence gathering.

Features include:
- Generating a supplement list (optionally from LLM).
- Querying an LLM with and without search anchoring.
- Storing analysis results in JSON format.
- Simple user profile to rank recommendations based on the analysis.

Note: The implementation uses placeholders for the actual Gemini API calls.

The repository includes a small example supplement list in `supplements.txt` as a placeholder.
